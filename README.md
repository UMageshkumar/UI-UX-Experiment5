#  UX Project Scenarios – Problem Statements, Research Methods & Personas

## AIM

To explore two distinct UX project scenarios by identifying user pain points, writing clear problem statements, selecting appropriate research methods, and creating user personas based on target user needs and behaviors.

## ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Select Two Different UX Project Scenarios
- Choose two projects from different domains (e.g., a health & fitness app and an e-commerce platform).
- Briefly define the scope and purpose of each project.

### Step 2: Identify User Pain Points
- Analyze each scenario and identify typical challenges users may face (e.g., difficulty in booking a doctor’s appointment, lack of product filter options).
- Consider both functional and emotional pain points.

### Step 3: Write UX Problem Statements
- Use the template:  
  **"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."**
- Write 1–2 problem statements for each scenario that reflect real user challenges.

### Step 4: Identify Suitable Research Methods
- Choose user research methods appropriate for each project, such as:
  - **Surveys** for collecting broad quantitative data

### Step 5: Create User Personas
- Based on either real data (if available) or assumed target users, create two personas per project.

## RESULT

Successfully analyzed two different UX project scenarios by identifying core user pain points and framing them into structured problem statements. Chose and justified relevant research methods to understand user needs better. Created realistic user personas representing different demographics, behaviors, and goals. These outputs provide a strong foundation for UX design decisions and help ensure user-centered solutions across both scenarios.
